This is an ERD for a hypothetical investment robo-advising app, like [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/)'s or [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/)'s.

Of course, a robo-advising app should be incredibly complex, so this ERD should only cover a small part of its functionality.

I built this ERD with [draw.io](https://draw.io/). To extend or modify it, download the file and import it to [draw.io](https://draw.io/).
